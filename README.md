# Language Model Toolbox

The Language Model Toolbox is a collection of Python utilities and helper functions for working with large language models, specifically using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 architecture. This toolbox provides a set of tools and guidelines to facilitate the development, deployment, and fine-tuning of language models for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Features

- **Model Integration**: Easily integrate and interact with different language models.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess raw text data to ensure compatibility with the language model input requirements.
- **Text Generation**: Generate coherent and contextually relevant text using the language model.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the Language Model Toolbox:

1. **Installation**: Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install llm_toolbox
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**: Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

3. **Import the Toolbox**: Import the necessary modules into your Python script or notebook:
   ```python
   from llm_toolbox import ChatGptPetition
   ```

4. **API Credentials**: Obtain your API credentials from the LLm provider by creating an account on their website and generating an API key.

5. **Model Integration**: Set up the model integration by providing your API key and configuring the model settings:
   ```python
   model_integration = ChatGptPetition(model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo')
   ```
